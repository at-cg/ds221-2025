## INSTRUCTIONS
All problems must be solved using C++ and compile/execute correctly on the Rigel cluster. You may test and debug on your local machine, but the final evaluation will be done on Rigel.

All performance numbers given in your report should be on Rigel compute nodes. Profiling experiments should be run during your assigned timeslot to avoid performance interference. We should be able to reproduce your performance results.

You are required to actively use Copilot to solve the programming part of the problem, to generate the solution code, and to test code. You are responsible for checking the accuracy of the code, including edge cases.

You MUST NOT collaborate with other students or take help from other (non-Copilot) online sources to solve any part of the problem, including code, prompts, algorithms, time/space complexity, etc.

You are provided a `main.cpp` file which calls helper functions for tasks such as file reading and writing output to a file. By default, this uses the sample input and output provided by us. You can edit the file paths in `main.cpp` if you need to change the input files. You must not change anything else in `main.cpp`. We will run our own test cases using this file, so any modifications beyond the allowed changes could affect your evaluation. You are also not allowed to change the other files used for file operations (`file_writer.h`, `file_reader.h`).

All functions you write should be added to the `user_code.h` file. You must adhere to the function signatures specified in `user_code.h`. You are allowed to add additional helper functions to `user_code.h` if necessary, as long as the main function signatures remain unchanged.

DO NOT PRINT ANYTHING TO THE CONSOLE from code you write in the final submission. Your code will be auto-graded. Any deviation from instructions will cause grading to fail and you will get zero points.

## SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS

Please submit a zipped file `iischandle.zip` where you replace `iischandle` with the prefix of your IISc email (e.g., `parveshbarak` if your IISc email is `parveshbarak@iisc.ac.in`). Inside this zip file, you will have a single folder named `iischandle/`, and within this folder include exactly two files:  
  1. `user_code.h` – This file should contain all of your code.  
  2. `iischandle.pdf` – This file should include your experimental setup, observations and analysis, plots, and any other required documentation and acknowledgements.  

So the file structure should look like this:  
```
iischandle.zip
|--iischandle\
   |-- user_code.h
   |-- iischandle.pdf
```
**Any deviation from the specified file or folder names, or failure to follow the instructions for completing the assignment, *will* result in a penalty.**

We will separately share a feedback form on Copilot to be filled *after the deadline*.

**Since the use of Copilot is allowed, please make sure to implement the most efficient algorithm to solve each question.**

## PROBLEM CONTEXT

You are working as a software engineer for a parcel delivery company. The company handles parcels, trucks, delivery routes, and customer requests daily. Your job is to write efficient algorithms to manage these operations.

## QUESTIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Q1.
You are given a list of parcels, where each parcel is represented by its ID and weight. Some parcels may appear more than once in the list (i.e., duplicate IDs). Two parcels with the same parcel ID but different weights should be considered duplicates.  

Your task is to detect all duplicate parcels and return the minimum weight occurrence of each duplicate parcel in the specified output format.  

- Complete the function named **question_one** in the code template.  
- The function syntax, input format, and output format are described in the `function_syntax.md` file.  
- Sample input and output for sanity check:  
  * `sample_tests/question1/input.txt`  
  * `sample_tests/question1/output.txt`  

#### Grading  
- 1 mark for code  
- 1 mark for Copilot prompt  
- 2 marks for profiling and report  


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Q2.
The logistics division of the company has designed an automated parcel routing system. The system is modeled as a binary conveyor network:  
- Each junction is represented as a node. A junction splits into two belts, sending parcels either left or right.  
- The topmost junction is numbered 0 and is known as the root junction.  
- Junctions are numbered in level-order traversal (from top to bottom, left to right).  
- Parcels are eventually routed to loading junctions (leaf nodes). From there, they are sent to trucks bound for different destinations.  

At any given time, the company tracks:  
- A mapping of parcels to loading junctions.  
- A query list of parcels, which contains the parcel IDs that got damaged.  

The inspection team wants to find the highest-numbered junction ID on which all the items in the query list were present.  
The inspection team has received **k** query lists and wants to find the junctions for each query list efficiently.  
Your goal is to help the inspection team.  

A query list contains parcel IDs that must all be gathered together for a special inspection.  
To perform this inspection efficiently, the company doesn’t need to physically bring all parcels to a single location. Instead, the inspection can be carried out at the highest possible junction (i.e., the junction with the largest index in level order) that still has all the parcels in the query.  

#### Input 
- A binary tree representing the conveyor network.  
- A mapping of parcels currently present at each loading junction.  
- **k** query lists of parcel IDs for inspection.  

#### Output  
Return the highest-numbered junction ID (i.e., junction with the largest index in level order) for each query list such that all the items of the list are present on that junction.  

- The function syntax, input format, and output format are described in the `function_syntax.md` file.  
- Sample input and output for sanity check:  
  * `sample_tests/question2/input.txt`  
  * `sample_tests/question2/output.txt`  

#### Grading  
- 2 marks for code  
- 1 mark for Copilot prompt  
- 4 marks for profiling and report

### Q3.


A logistics company operates warehouses in several cities across the country. The country’s road map can be represented as a weighted graph:  
- Each city is a node (numbered 1 to n).  
- Each road between two cities is an edge, with the weight representing the travel time.  

Two trucks start their journeys simultaneously:  
- One from Kargil (node 1).  
- One from Kanyakumari (node n).  

Among the n cities, k of them are metro cities equipped with booster fuel stations. At these stations:  
- Refueling takes 0 time.  
- Once a truck refuels, its speed doubles, meaning the travel time on every subsequent road is reduced to half the original time.  

The drivers of the two trucks are old school friends who wish to meet each other as soon as possible. Your task is to determine the earliest possible time at which they can meet, if they both follow optimal routes.  

Complete function **question_three**, and if the two trucks cannot meet due to no connection between Kargil and Kanyakumari (i.e., if nodes 1 and n are disconnected), return -1.  

#### Input  
- The graph of the country: cities (nodes) and roads (edges with travel times).  
- A list of cities containing booster fuel stations.  
- Note: For simplification, all edge weights (travel times) are guaranteed to be even numbers.  

#### Output  
- The minimum time units after which the two trucks can meet.  
- Return -1 if no meeting is possible.  

#### Additional Information  
- The function signature, input format, and output format are described in `function_syntax.md`.  
- Example test files for sanity check:  
  * `sample_tests/question3/input.txt`  
  * `sample_tests/question3/output.txt`  

#### Grading  
- 3 marks for code  
- 2 marks for Copilot prompt  
- 4 marks for profiling and report

Q2:

The company's warehouse uses a conveyor belt system structured as a binary tree.
Each node in the tree represents a junction, where parcels can be directed either left or right based on their destination city.
The root node (junction 0) is called the root junction.
The leaf nodes are called loading junctions, where parcels finally accumulate before being loaded onto trucks.
Junctions are numbered in level-order traversal order from 0 to m.
Parcels are initially placed at the root junction and are routed down the conveyor belts to different loading junctions (leaf nodes).
- You are given:
  - A binary tree representing the conveyor netw.
  - A mapping of parcels currently present at each loading junction.
  - A query list of parcel IDs.
- Task:
  - Find the highest-numbered junction ID (i.e., junction with the largest index in level order) such that all parcels from the query list were present in the subtree rooted at that junction.
- The function syntax, input and output format is described in the `function_syntax.md` file
- Sample input and output for sanity check:
  * tests_Q3/preorder.txt
  * tests_Q3/inorder.txt
  * tests_Q3/leaf_parcels.txt
  * tests_Q3/query_parcels.txt
  * tests_Q3/junction.txt




Q3:

The company operates warehouses in few city of the country. The road map of the country can be represented as a weighted graph:
Each city is a node. (total n nodes numberd 1 t n)
Each road between two cities is an edge with the time taken to travel that road. (total m roads)
There are two trucks, one start from kargilcity (i.e. node 1) and other starts from the city Kanyakumari (i.e. node n).
Out of n cities, there are k metro cities who have booster feul stations, feul filling can be done in no time (0 seconds), but once filled with the booster fuel, the spped of truck doubles hence time to travel any road thereafter only takes half the original time. The drivers of the two trucks are school friends meeting after a long time and want to meet each other as soon as possible. They have requested you to help them find earliest time they can meet if they follow the best possible path. Your job is to output the earliest time they can meet. Complete function question_four and retirn -1 if they can not meet each other due to no connection between kargil and kanyakumari i.e if node 1 and n are disconnected.

- You are given:
  - A graph of the country (cities and roads with time taken to travel on those roads).
  - A list of cities whcih hasve booster fuel stations.
  - For simplification, the time taken to travel on any road without booster feul is even (i.e. edge weights are even)
- Task:
  - Determine the min time units after which they can meet each other.
- The function syntax, input and output format is described in the `function_syntax.md` file
- Sample input and output for sanity check:
  * tests_Q4/edges.csv
  * tests_Q4/trucks.csv
  * tests_Q4/order_of_arrival.txt -->
